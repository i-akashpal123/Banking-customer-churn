# Banking-Customer-Churn-Prediction-
This repository contains a dataset and code for predicting bank customer churn using basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modeling and visualizing churn rates in Power BI.

# Dataset Description:
The dataset used in this project is the Bank Customer Churn dataset, containing the following columns:
CustomerId: Contains random values and does not affect customers leaving the bank.
Surname: The surname of a customer has no impact on their decision to leave the bank.
CreditScore: This can affect customer churn since a customer with a higher credit score is less likely to leave the bank.
Country: A customer’s location can affect their decision to leave the bank.
Gender: It’s interesting to explore whether gender plays a role in a customer leaving the bank.
Age: This is certainly relevant since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger ones.
Balance: This is also an excellent indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.
NumOfProducts: Refers to the number of products a customer has purchased through the bank.
Credit card: Denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant since people with credit card are less likely to leave the bank.
ActiveMember: Active customers are less likely to leave the bank.
Churn: Whether or not the customer left the bank.

# Methodology:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Basic EDA techniques were employed to understand the dataset's characteristics and distributions of features.

Predictive Modeling: A basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was implemented to predict customer churn. The model achieved an accuracy of 79.75%.

Visualization in Power BI: The dataset was utilized in Power BI to visualize the churn rate of the bank by various factors such as gender, activity, location, credit card status, and age group.
